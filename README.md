# code-quiz

## Task
- Create a coding quiz that follows the acceptance criteria
- Make sure you can click through, presenting new questions each time
- Subtract time fro wrong answers
- Build a high score display that stores data in local storage

## Process
- Create a basic HTML and CSS sheet that will enable multiple questions to be asked, leaving room for high-score
- Build the javascript functionality that will allow eventListeners and clickable events to perform functions
- Add a timer to the JS that allows time to be subtracted for wrong answers
- Store high-score info in local storage so that it can be presented even after reloading page

## What I learned
- I got a lot more familiar with JS, speecifically the timing interval, evenListeners, and building my own functions
- I learned how to create a modal and add CSS animation for a more detailed touch and dynamic page
- I learned and got familiar with how to display/hide items, and make them included in the page so that they do not take up space while hidden
- Solidified skills with defining variables in JS that correspond HTML elements
